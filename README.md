This project presents a comprehensive classification framework that addresses imbalanced big data using a hybrid pipeline of advanced machine learning and deep learning methods. The core components are:
•	FADA-SMOTE for effective synthetic oversampling
•	XGB-BHPO (Extreme Gradient Boosting with Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization) for optimal feature selection
•	COA (Coati Optimization Algorithm) to mitigate vanishing gradient issues
•	GAN-ELM (Generative Adversarial Network with Extreme Learning Machine) for high-accuracy classification
•	Physics-Informed Policy Gradient Network to embed domain-specific knowledge for interpretability and reliability.

•	The proposed method helps to tackle the class imbalance problem effectively, which is a major challenge in big data classification, especially in domains like medical imaging.
•	IT offers high accuracy and robustness in classification tasks by integrating multiple optimized components.
•	It Scales well with large datasets while maintaining low computational cost, making it suitable for real-world, high-throughput systems.
•	The modular design allows for easy adaptation to other domains beyond medical data (e.g., facial recognition or long-tailed object classification).
The proposed method is implemented in Python environment with packages for machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn, xgboost, tensorflow/keras or pytorch, etc.).
Dataset Preparation: Use publicly available datasets like:
Breast Cancer Histopathology images
CelebA Facial Attribute Dataset
ImageNet-LT
Execution: Follow the paper’s methodology to:
Preprocess data using FADA-SMOTE
Perform feature selection using XGB-BHPO
Classify using the GAN-ELM model with COA and Physics-Informed Policy Gradient
Evaluate using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC, MCC, and Specificity.
